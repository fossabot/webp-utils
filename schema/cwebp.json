For a very large image, 512k only leaves room to few bits per 16x16 macroblock. The absolute minimum is 4 bits per macroblock. Skip, segment, and mode information can use up almost all these 4 bits (although the case is unlikely), which is problematic for very large images. The partition_limit factor controls how frequently the most bit-costly mode (intra 4x4) will be used.
